## **Project**

The aim of this project was to build a working, deployable Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch, using the programming skills learnt over the last few weeks of my General Assembly Software Engineering course.


## **Description**

A very basic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

The game keeps track of scores, with the ability to play against another person in a local environment or a (very bad) Computer opponent.

The live game state is stored in Local Storage which can be retrieved at a later time. Upon opening the game again you will be prompted with the option to restore the previous session as below.

## **Future Updates**
Future updates will include -
- Personalize player names
- Ability to change player tokens (X, O)
- Networked Multiplayer options
- More CSS styling
